      <li>Where should you use constants, and where should you use variables? Can they all be constants?</li>
      <p>
				[Constants are used for variables that are used multiple times througout a program that does not change, a variable is used when you want its value to change. You cannot use only constants]
			</p>
      <li>How do parentheses affect the arithmetic outcome of an expression?</li>
      <p>
				[Parentheses determine what part of the the equation is performed in what order. spesificaly the inner parentheses are performed first and works outwards]
			</p>
      <li>How do we limit floating-point numbers to a given number of decimals?</li>
      <p>
				[Using .tofixed() will determine how many decimals in a number]
			</p>
      <li>How can we compare two floating-point values to see if they are equal (is 12.199999 the same as 12.2)?</li>
      <p>
				[12.199999==12.2]
			</p>
      <li>What do comparison operators return, and how can we check if they are FALSE or TRUE?</li>
      <p>
				[they return either true of false, we can use a printOut and .tostring() to tell what they are]
			</p>
      <li>How does the Math.random() function work, and what can it be used for?</li>
      <p>
				[It produces a psuedo random number between equal to 0 and up to 1. it has historicly been used for games, but can also be used for online security]
			</p>
      <li>What is modulus (%), and when do we need this operator in mathematical operations?</li>
      <p>
				[Modulus devides by a number and returns the whats left, for 7%4 it would return 3]
