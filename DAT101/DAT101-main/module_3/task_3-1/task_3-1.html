      <li>Discuss the behavior of part 1, What happens when the wake-up time is not 7 and what happens when it is exactly 7?</li>
      <p>[When wake-up time is not exactly 7 then the if statement is not true and nothing else happens. when it is 7 exactly the if statement is true and it prints that they can take the buss.]</p>
      <li>Same as question #1. How ever the answer should now be different. Discuss the behaviour of part 2, What happens when the wake-up time is not 7 and what happens when it is exactly 7?</li>
      <p>[Now when the wake-up time is not 7 it prints out that they have to take the car. otherwise when wake-up is 7 they can take the buss.]</p>
      <li>Discuss the behavior of part 3, what happens when wake time is less than 7 or greater than 8?</li>
      <p>[Both less than 7 and more than 8 means that they have to take the car. this might not make sense since earlier than 7 should still include both options.]</p>
      <li>Discuss the behavior for part 4, what happens if the number is exactly 0, is zero positive or negative?</li>
      <p>[Mathamaticly zero is neither positive nor negative. when checking fif it is positive or negative it would either give no answer or a false answer depending on how you do it.]</p>
